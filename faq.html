                <h3>FAQ:</h3>
                <p>PeakFestival is the largest electronic music festival held in England, taking place in the largest
                    nation park in the UK, Peak District. It is held annually and has been designated Best Major
                    Festival in the European Festival Awards every year since first edition in 2010. Guests come from a
                    vast range of European countries, as well as Asia and North America, US.</p>
                <p>Because of the actual situation, this year we have decided to keep our festival online, giving the
                    chance to our people to enjoy their favorite festival from their own houses.</p>

                <p>1. How are we going to watch the show? <br> The show can be seen on every device as time as the
                    device is connected to the internet. For mobile
                    and tablets there is an app, Peak Festival app, and you an downlaod the app from our website, for
                    both, Apple and Android. With 2 days before the show one code will be provided. The code can be used
                    only for one device at a time. More devices, more tickets must be bought! For laptop, the show can
                    be seen with Zoom app, and again the access code will be sent with two days before the show.</p>

                <p>2. When can I decide (the latest), if I want to buy tickets for 2022? <br> For the 2022 edition, you must show your option to participate until March 31, 2022.</p>
            
                <p>3. If I decide after March 31, 2022 that I want to participate at Prak Festival 2022, will it be
                    possible? <br> Choosing the option to participate at Peak Festival 2022 is still possible after
                    March 31, 2022 but
                    it will come with a fee of 15 EUR, within the available stock. If the event is announced "SOLD OUT",
                    this option will no longer be available</p>
